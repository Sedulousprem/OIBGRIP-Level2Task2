    <h2 style="font-size:3rem">Biography:</h2>
    <p class="main">Richard Phillips Feynman was an American theoretical physicist known for his work in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, and the physics of the superfluidity of supercooled liquid helium, as well as in particle physics for which he proposed the parton model.</p>
    <p class="main">He assisted in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II and became known to a wide public in the 1980s as a member of the commision that investigated the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster.</p>

    <p class="main">Feynman developed a widely used pictorial representation scheme for the mathematical expressions describing the behavior of subatomic particles, which later became known as Feynman diagrams. During his lifetime, Feynman became one of the best-known scientists in the world. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, he was ranked the seventh-greatest physicist of all time.</p>
